                <h1>Create a Repository on GitHub</h1>
                <li>
                    create a new Repo <br>
                    We will go over the different options and what they mean later. But for now, choose Public (if you want the repo to be
                    viewable for anyone) or Private (if you want to choose who should be able to view the repo). Either way, you will be
                    able to choose who can contribute to the repo.
                    Then click "Create repository".
                </li>
                <h1>Push Local Repository to GitHub</h1>
                <li>
                    Since we have already set up a local Git repo, we are going to push that to GitHub <br>
                    Copy the URL, or click the clipboard marked in the image above.
                    Now paste it the following command: git remote add origin https://github.com/w3schools-test/hello-world.git <br>
                    git remote add origin URL specifies that you are adding a remote repository, with the specified URL, as an origin to
                    your local Git repo.
                    Now we are going to push our master branch to the origin url, and set it as the default remote branch: git push origin master <br>
                    Now, go back into GitHub and see that the repository has been updated:
                </li>

            <div>
                <h1>Git Pull from GitHub</h1>
                <h2>Pulling to Keep up-to-date with Changes</h2>
                <li>
                    When working as a team on a project, it is important that everyone stays up to date.
                    Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local copy.
                    With Git, you can do that with pull.
                    pull is a combination of 2 different commands: <br>
                    fetch
                    merge <br>
                    Let's take a closer look into how fetch, merge, and pull works.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Git Fetch</h1>
                <li>
                    fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.
                    So, on your local Git, fetch updates to see what has changed on GitHub: git fetch origin <br>
                    Now that we have the recent changes we can check our status <br>
                    We are behind the origin/master by 1 commit. That should be the updated README.md, but lets double check by viewing the
                    log <br>
                    That looks as expected, but we can also verify by showing the differences between our local master and origin/master: git diff <br>
                    That looks precisely as expected! Now we can safely merge
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Git Merge</h1>
                <li>
                    merge combines the current branch, with a specified branch.
                    We have confirmed that the updates are as expected, and we can merge our current branch (master) with origin master:git merge origin master <br>
                    Check our status again to confirm we are up to date.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Git Pull</h1>
                <li>
                    But what if you just want to update your local repository, without going through all those steps?
                    pull is a combination of fetch and merge. It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you
                    are working on. Make another change to the Readme.md file on GitHub.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use pull to update our local Git: git pull origin <br>
                    That is how you keep your local Git up to date from a remote repository.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Git Push to GitHub</h1>
                <h2>Push Changes to GitHub</h2>
                <li>
                    Let's try making some changes to our local git and pushing them to GitHub. Commit the changes <br>
                    And check the status, <br> Now push our changes to our remote origin, Go to GitHub, and confirm that the repository has a new commit
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Git Pull Branch from GitHub</h1>
                <li>
                    Now continue working on our new branch in our local Git.
                    Lets pull from our GitHub repository again so that our code is up-to-date <br>
                    Now our main branch is up todate. And we can see that there is a new branch available on GitHub.
                    Do a quick status check And confirm which branches we have, and where we are working at the moment:
                </li> 
                <li>
                    So, we do not have the new branch on our local Git. But we know it is available on GitHub. So we can use the -a option
                    to see all local and remote branches, We see that the branch html-skeleton is available remotely, but not on our local git. Lets check it out <br>
                    And check if it is all up to date, Which branches do we have now, and where are we working from?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, open your favourite editor and confirm that the changes from the GitHub branch carried over.
                    That is how you pull a GitHub branch to your local Git.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Git Push Branch to GitHub</h1>
                <li>
                    After you make and commit changes locally, you can share them with the remote repository using git push. Pushing changes
                    to the remote makes your commits accessible to others who you may be collaborating with. This will also update any open
                    pull requests with the branch that you're working on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As best practice, it's important to run the git pull command before you push any new changes to the remote branch. This
                    will update your local branch with any new changes that may have been pushed to the remote from other contributors.
                    Pulling before you push can reduce the amount of merge conflicts you create on GitHub - allowing you to resolve them
                    locally before pushing your changes to the remote branch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Common usages and options for git push
                    git push -f: Force a push that would otherwise be blocked, usually because it will delete or overwrite existing commits
                    (Use with caution!) <br>
                    <li> git push -u origin [branch]: Useful when pushing a new branch, this creates an upstream tracking branch with a lasting
                    <li>relationship to your local branch</li>
                    <li> git push --all: Push all branches</li>
                    <li> git push --tags: Publish tags that aren't yet in the remote repository</li>
                    <li>  You can see all of the options with git push in git-scm's documentation.</li>
                </li>
