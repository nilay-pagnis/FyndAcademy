            <h1>Git</h1>
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li> Git Install <br>
                You can download Git for free from the following website: https://www.git-scm.com/ </li> <br>
                
                <li> Using Git with Command Line
                To start using Git, we are first going to open up our Command shell. <br>
                For Windows, you can use Git bash, which comes included in Git for Windows. For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in
                terminal.
                The first thing we need to do, is to check if Git is properly installed: </li> <br>
                
               <li> Example
                git --version
                git version 2.30.2.windows.1
                If Git is installed, it should show something like git version X.Y <br>
                
                Configure Git
                Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:
                
                Example
                git config --global user.name "w3schools-test"
                git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"
                Change the user name and e-mail address to your own. You will probably also want to use this when registering to GitHub
                later on. </li> <br>
                
                <li> Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
                If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global <br>
                Creating Git Folder
                Now, let's create a new folder for our project:
                
                Example
                mkdir myproject
                cd myproject
                mkdir makes a new directory.</li> <br>
                
                 <li> cd changes the current working directory.
                Now that we are in the correct directory. We can start by initializing Git!
                Note: If you already have a folder/directory you would like to use for Git:
                Navigate to it in command line, or open it in your file explorer, right-click and select "Git Bash here"
                Initialize Git
                Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:
                Example
                git init
                Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/
                You just created your first Git Repository! </li><br>
                Note: Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on.
                Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes. 
            </div>

            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h1>Git New Files</h1>
                <p>
                    Git Adding New Files
                    You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.
                    So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor. Then save or move it to the folder you
                    just created.
                    If you want to learn how to create a new file using a text editor, you can visit our HTML tutorial:
                    HTML Editors
                    For this example, I am going to use a simple HTML file like this:
                </p>
                <li>
                    And save it to our new folder as index.html.
                    Let's go back to the terminal and list the files in our current working directory:
                </li>
                <li>ls will list the files in the directory. We can see that index.html is there.
                Then we check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo:</li>
                <li>
                    Now Git is aware of the file, but has not added it to our repository!
                    Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:
                    Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
                    Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
                    When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage
                    them, or add them to the staging environment.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h1>Git Staging Environment</h1>
                <li>
                    One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.
                    As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of
                    the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.
                    Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about
                    commit shortly.
                    For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to the Staging Environment: git add index.html
                </li>
                <li>
                    The file should be Staged
                    Note: The shorthand command for git add --all is git add -A
                </li>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h1>Git Commit</h1>
                <li>
                    Since we have finished our work, we are ready move from stage to commit for our repo.
                    Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each commit change point or "save
                    point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.
                    When we commit, we should always include a message.
                    By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when.
                </li>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h1>Git Branch</h1>
                <li>
                    Let add some new features to our index.html page.
                    We are working in our local repository, and we do not want to disturb or possibly wreck the main project.
                    So we create a new branch: git branch hello-world-images
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now we created a new branch called "hello-world-images"
                    Let's confirm that we have created a new branch:git branch hello-world-images * master
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can see the new branch with the name "hello-world-images", but the * beside master specifies that we are currently on
                    that branch.
                    checkout is the command used to check out a branch. Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end
                    of the command: git checkout hello-world-images
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now we have moved our current workspace from the master branch, to the new branch
                    Open your favourite editor and make some changes.
                    For this example, we added an image (img_hello_world.jpg) to the working folder and a line of code in the index.html
                    We have made changes to a file and added a new file in the working directory (same directory as the main branch).
                    Now check the status of the current branch:
                </li>
                <li>
                    So let's go through what happens here:
                    #There are changes to our index.html, but the file is not staged for commit
                    #img_hello_world.jpg is not tracked
                    So we need to add both files to the Staging Environment for this branch: git add --all
                    Using --all instead of individual filenames will Stage all changed (new, modified, and deleted) files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the status of the branch <br>
                    We are happy with our changes. So we will commit them to the branch <br>
                    Now we have a new branch, that is different from the master branch <br>
                    Note: Using the -b option on checkout will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist
                </li>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h1>Git Branch Merge</h1>
                <li>
                    We have the emergency fix ready, and so let's merge the master and emergency-fix branches.
                    First, we need to change to the master branch: git checkout master <br>
                    Now we merge the current branch (master) with emergency-fix: git merge emergency-fix <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since the emergency-fix branch came directly from master, and no other changes had been made to master while we were
                    working, Git sees this as a continuation of master. So it can "Fast-forward", just pointing both master and
                    emergency-fix to the same commit.
                    As master and emergency-fix are essentially the same now, we can delete emergency-fix, as it is no longer needed: git branch -d emergency-fix
                </li>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <h1>Merge Conflict</h1>
                <li>
                    Now we can move over to hello-world-images and keep working. Add another image file (img_hello_git.jpg) and change
                    index.html, so it shows it: git checkout hello-world-images <br>
                    Now, we are done with our work here and can stage and commit for this branch: git add --all
                </li>
                <li>
                    We see that index.html has been changed in both branches. Now we are ready to merge hello-world-images into master. But
                    what will happen to the changes we recently made in master? git checkout master <br>
                    The merge failed, as there is conflict between the versions for index.html. Let us check the status <br>
                    This confirms there is a conflict in index.html, but the image files are ready and staged to be committed.
                    So we need to fix that conflict <br>
                    We can see the differences between the versions and edit it like we want. Now we can stage index.html and check the status <br>
                    The conflict has been fixed, and we can use commit to conclude the merge: git commit -m "merged with hello-world-images after fixing conflicts"
                </li>
                <li>
                    And delete the hello-world-images branch: git branch -d hello-world-images <br>
                    Now you have a better understanding of how branches and merging works.
                </li>
